# Custom Post Type Security

This project is a plugin which installs a custom post type - based on the tutorial [here](https://typerocket.com/ultimate-guide-to-custom-post-types-in-wordpress/).

## So what's going on?
After installing the plugin - a subscriber with what appears to be appropriate privilages is able to create a study post record, but unable to submit it for review.


## Steps to recreate the issue.

* Install the plugin into a wordpress site.
* As an administrator, the plugin grants all permissions to the administrator user.  
* Administrator can create and publish studies.
* Create a subscriber user

* Install the [Capability Manager Enhanced](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/capability-manager-enhanced/) plugin
*
